Dataset is saved as CSV file separated by semicolons. There are no special symbols for missing data. Missing data are simply empty cells in the spreadsheed. 

The dataset has following columns:

1) Year - year of the study

2) Focal_nest - identity of the nest in which chicks, whose values are given on the same row, were raised and measured. Labelled as "recipient nest" in the article.

Example for 2011 when full cross-fostering between pairs of nests was done: In the second row nestling mass is indicated as 8.03 grams. This is the mean of chicks that were raised in the nest b11. These chicks hatched in b11 from eggs that were originally laid in s34. If one want to know nestling mass of chicks raised in s34, from eggs laid in b11, they would need to find s34 amongfocal nests, which is on the row 27 and their weight is 8.80 g.

3) Paired_nest - identity of the nest that was in the dyad with a particular focal nest. Labelled as "donor nest" in the article. From paired nest all eggs (in 2011, and in enlarged treatment in 2012), some eggs (in reduced treatment in 2012) or a chick (in enlarged treatment in 2014) were given to the focal nest. For reduced treatment in 2014, no chicks were transferred from paired to the focal nests. Note that each nest appears both as focal nest and paired nest. 

4) Laying_date - laying date of the first egg in a focal nest (1st January = 1).

5) Initial_clutch_size - clutch size laid in focal nests, before any manipulations were done.

6) Treatment - treatment in the focal nest. "Reduced" means experimentally decreased clutch size (in 2011) or brood size (in 2012 and 2014) in the focal nest and the opposite change in the paired nest.

7) Egg_volume - mean egg volume of eggs from which chicks, whose values are given on the same row, hatched. These eggs were laid in paired nests in 2011 and 2012, where cross-fostering was done but in focal nests in 2014 when cross-fostering was not done.

8) Nestling_mass - mean mass (grams) of 6-day old chicks that were raised in the focal nest. Values of 2 chicks that remained in their original nests (in enlarged treatment in 2012) or 1 chick that was transferred from paired nest (in enlarged treatment in 2014) were not used for the calculation of this mean nestling mass. Also excluded were values of all chicks that did not fledge.

9) Fledging_tarsus - mean tarsus length (mm) of 13-day old nestlings raised in the focal nest. Exclusion of some chicks from calculations of brood means as for nestling mass.

10) Fledging_mass - mean mass (grams) of 13-day old nestlings raised in the focal nest. Exclusion of some chicks from calculations of brood means as for nestling mass.

11) Wing_length - mean wing length (mm) of 13-day old nestlings raised in the focal nest. Exclusion of some chicks from calculations of brood means as for nestling mass

12) Number_hatched - number of focal young at the start of nestling period (i.e. number of chicks hatched in focal nests in 2011, number of 2-day old chicks transferred to focal nests from paired nests in 2012, and number of chicks that hatched and remained in their original nests in 2014).
 
13) Number_fledged - number of focal young that fledged.
