This dataset contains data from:

Krist, M., Remeš, V., Uvírová, L., Nádvorník, P. & Bureš, S. (2004) Egg size and offspring performance in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis): a within-clutch approach. Oecologia, 140, 52-60.

Dataset is saved as CSV file separated by semicolons. There are no special symbols for missing data. Missing data are simply empty cells in the spreadsheed.


The dataset has following columns:

year - year of the study (2001 and 2002)
nest identity
season - values are deviations of the laying date in the focal nest from the median laying date in the particular year. Units: days.
clutch size - number of eggs laid in the focal nest
mean egg volume - mean egg volume in the focal nest (in mm3)

chick identity
Further columns contain values specific to individual chicks:

laying order - laying order of the egg from which the chick hatched
egg volume - volume of the egg from which the chick hatched (in mm3)
relative egg volume - a deviation of egg volume from the mean egg volume (i.e. within-nest centered value), in mm3
chick hatched? - whether the egg hatched (=yes) or did not hatch (=no)
hatching asynchrony - delay in hatching (in hours) of the particular chick compared to its nest-mate that hatched first
time to return - time elapsed between the chick hatched and was returned to the original nests (in hours)
sex
paternity - binary variable describing whether the chick was fathered by social partner (=social) or extra-pair male (=extra)
mass1 - mass13 - body mass of the chick at brood age 1-13. Brood age 0 is the day when majority of chicks hatched in the focal nest.
tarsus length - tarsus length at brood age 13 (in mm)
nestling survival - binary variable describing whether the chick fledged or died in the nest.
recruitment - binary variable describing whether the chick recruited to breeding population in two (for chicks fledged in 2001) or one (for chicks fledged in 2002) year after fledging
