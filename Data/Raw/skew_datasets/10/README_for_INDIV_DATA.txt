VARIABLE		DESCRIPTION

YEAR
HABITAT			Breeding habitat; coded as DF = deciduous forest, CF = coniferous forest
SEX			Coded as M = male, F = female
IDENTITY		Individual identification number; equivalent to the ring code.
T LENGTH		Tarsus length to the nearest 0.05 mm
AGE 1stREP		Age of first reproduction
NATorIMM		Individuals' origin; coded as R = resident, I = immigrant
NAT FLOW		Natal dispersal (i.e. from the natal area to the area of first reproduction); coded as "ORIGIN"to"DESTINY"; NONE denotes the absence of movement.  
REP FLOW		Breeding dispersal (i.e. from the area of 1st reproduction to that of subsequent reproductions); coded as "ORIGIN"to"DESTINY" NONE denotes the absence of movement.
